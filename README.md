## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I’m **Sourav Kumar**, a second semester Computer Science student at **UCET Hazaribagh**, fueled by an obsession with **learning by building**.

Coming from Jharkhand, where tech resources aren’t abundant, I’ve learned to **thrive with intent, grit, and resourcefulness**. I'm not just chasing placements or certificates — I’m focused on mastering the core skills that create **real-world impact**.

What makes me different?
- I don’t follow tutorials blindly — I **deconstruct, build from scratch**, and **teach others**.
- I treat every project like a mini startup — with problem-solving, scalability, and ownership in mind.
- I value **clarity over hype**, **principles over shortcuts**, and **execution over theory**.

If you're into building clean products, solving real problems, and leveling up relentlessly — we already share a mindset.

## 🚀 Skills & Tech Stack

> My stack reflects a full-stack mindset — learn deeply, build fast, scale smart.

### 🔧 Core Programming
- **Java (Core + OOP)** – My foundation for DSA, object-oriented design, and logic building
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Asynchronous flow, modern syntax, browser APIs, and beyond

### 🌐 Frontend Development
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – Strong grasp on layout, responsive design, and interactivity
- **React.js** – Component architecture, hooks, state management, and routing
- **Next.js** – Server-side rendering (SSR), file-based routing, and SEO optimization

### ⚙️ Backend Development
- **Node.js + Express.js** – RESTful APIs, modular routing, middleware logic
- **Authentication** – Secure JWT auth flows, hashed passwords with Bcrypt, token refresh
- **MVC Folder Structure** – Organized, scalable backend codebase

### 🗃️ Databases & Data Handling
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** – Schema design, queries, aggregation pipelines
- **JSON, Axios/Fetch** – Handling data in full-stack applications

### 🧪 Debugging & Testing Tools
- **Postman, Thunder Client** – API testing, headers, and response validation
- **MongoDB Compass** – Visual data inspection and schema analysis

### 🚀 Dev Tools & Workflow
- **Git + GitHub** – Branching, version control, and clean commits
- **VS Code** – Customized setup with extensions and theming for productivity
- **Notion + Docs** – Organized learning, roadmaps, and technical documentation
- **Linux CLI (Basics)** – For backend setup and local server control

## 🧠 My Learning Approach

> "Learning is only real when it's tested through building."

Here’s how I approach every new technology:

1. **Learn the core** – Start from the docs, official guides, and source code if needed  
2. **Apply immediately** – Build mini-projects or modules while learning  
3. **Debug deeply** – Face the "why isn’t this working?" phase head-on  
4. **Refactor and reflect** – Rebuild for scalability and clarity  
5. **Share & teach** – Explain to others, blog, or demo on GitHub

This loop helps me **truly internalize** concepts, not just memorize them. It's how I learned DSA, backend auth flows, and now front-end state management.

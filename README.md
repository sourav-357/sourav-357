## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I’m **Sourav Kumar**, a second-year Computer Science student at **UCET Hazaribagh**, fueled by an obsession with **learning by building**.

Coming from Jharkhand, where tech resources aren’t abundant, I’ve learned to **thrive with intent, grit, and resourcefulness**. I'm not just chasing placements or certificates — I’m focused on mastering the core skills that create **real-world impact**.

What makes me different?
- I don’t follow tutorials blindly — I **deconstruct, build from scratch**, and **teach others**.
- I treat every project like a mini startup — with problem-solving, scalability, and ownership in mind.
- I value **clarity over hype**, **principles over shortcuts**, and **execution over theory**.

If you're into building clean products, solving real problems, and leveling up relentlessly — we already share a mindset.

## 🧠 My Learning Approach

> I don’t just watch tutorials — I build, break, debug, and deliver.

My loop is simple but powerful:  
**Learn → Apply → Reflect → Improve**

This mindset fuels every skill, every project, and every challenge I take on.

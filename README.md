## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Sourav Kumar** — a Computer Science student from **UCET Hazaribagh** (Jharkhand, India), actively shaping my path into full-stack development.

Despite studying in a low-resource environment, I’ve made it my mission to self-learn, build, and grow through consistent effort. I don't just consume tutorials — I **apply, break, rebuild, and optimize** everything I learn.

### 🚀 What I Stand For:
- **Clarity over clutter** — clean code, structured thoughts.
- **Learning by doing** — every skill I pick up ends in a repo.
- **Hackathon-driven development** — shipping fast, learning faster.
- **Consistency beats talent** — I show up daily, no matter what.

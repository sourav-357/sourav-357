## 👋 **About Me** - 

Hello! I'm **Sourav Kumar**, a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate at **UCET Hazaribagh** with a burning passion to become a **top-tier full-stack developer**.  

Growing up in Jharkhand without abundant resources taught me one powerful lesson — **resilience and relentless self-improvement beat all odds**. Every day, I invest in building skills, crafting meaningful projects, and engaging with the tech community to turn ambition into impact.

> _"Innovation isn’t about having the best tools—it’s about making the most of what you have."_  

My philosophy is simple but powerful:  
- 🔍 **Clarity over complexity** — code should be clean, readable, and maintainable  
- 💡 **Build-first learning** — concepts only stick when applied in real projects  
- ⚡ **Hackathon energy** — fast iterations, MVP focus, and learning under pressure  
- ⏰ **Discipline > Motivation** — show up consistently, even when it’s tough

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Why I Use It

### Languages & Core Fundamentals  
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat-square&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)  
Java forms the backbone of my problem-solving skills and object-oriented programming expertise. I use it for mastering complex algorithms, data structures, and real-world system design.  

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat-square&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)  
JavaScript is my go-to for building dynamic, interactive web apps — from front-end UI logic to backend server scripting. Its flexibility fuels my full-stack journey.  

![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white)  
![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=flat-square&logo=css3&logoColor=white)  
Mastering semantic HTML and responsive CSS lets me create accessible, clean, and visually appealing web interfaces.  

---

### Backend Development  
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=flat-square&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)  
Node.js powers my server-side logic — event-driven, fast, and scalable. It lets me build real-time APIs and microservices efficiently.  

![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-000000?style=flat-square&logo=express&logoColor=white)  
Express.js is my minimalist framework for building RESTful APIs with clear routing, middleware, and robust error handling.  

![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)  
MongoDB provides flexible, schema-less NoSQL databases for rapid prototyping and scalable data storage. I pair it with Mongoose for object modeling.  

**Key backend skills:**  
- Building RESTful API endpoints with CRUD operations  
- Implementing secure authentication flows using JWT and bcrypt  
- Writing modular, testable server code  
- Deploying applications on cloud platforms  

---

### Frontend & Modern UI  
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)  
React.js is my framework of choice for creating reusable, component-driven UI with declarative rendering and efficient state management.  

![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=flat-square&logo=next.js&logoColor=white)  
Next.js adds powerful server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities — improving performance, SEO, and developer experience in my full-stack apps.  

---

### DevOps & Productivity Tools  
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat-square&logo=git&logoColor=white)  
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)  
I rely on Git and GitHub for version control, branching strategies, and collaboration. Managing commits and pull requests is second nature.  

![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=flat-square&logo=postman&logoColor=white)  
Postman helps me rigorously test API endpoints and automate workflows.  

![VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-007ACC?style=flat-square&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)  
VS Code is my daily driver — lightweight, extensible, and powerful.  

![Notion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notion-000000?style=flat-square&logo=notion&logoColor=white)  
I organize my projects, track progress, and document learnings with Notion — keeping focus and productivity high.

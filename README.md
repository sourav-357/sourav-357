## üéØ About Me

I'm a passionate **Computer Science student** at UCET Hazaribagh with an insatiable thirst for technology and innovation. Driven by curiosity, logic, and consistency, I'm on a mission to craft scalable, impactful, and innovative solutions with code.

### My Journey
My coding journey began in 2022 when I wrote my first "Hello World" program. Since then, I've evolved from a curious beginner to a dedicated developer who believes in the power of continuous learning and hands-on practice.

### Core Philosophy
- **"I don't aim to consume content ‚Äî I aim to earn mastery"** - Every tutorial becomes a foundation for innovation
- **"Every bug is a lesson, every project is a stepping stone"** - Failures are just iterations toward success  
- **"Code with purpose, build with passion, deploy with pride"** - Quality over quantity, impact over impressiveness

### What Makes Me Different
- **Problem Solver**: Breaking complex problems into manageable pieces
- **Builder**: Turning ideas into functional, scalable applications
- **Debugger**: Hunting down issues and optimizing performance
- **Refiner**: Polishing code for production-ready quality

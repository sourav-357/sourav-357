## 👋 About Me

Hey! I’m **Sourav Kumar**, currently pursuing Computer Science @ **UCET Hazaribagh**, and a builder at heart who believes in learning by doing. 🚀

Hailing from Jharkhand, where tech exposure is limited, I’ve turned constraints into clarity and self-discipline. My mission is not to just land a job — but to become the **kind of engineer** who solves real problems with real solutions. 💡

What makes me different?

- 🔍 I don’t follow tutorials blindly — I **dissect**, **rebuild**, and **teach** what I learn.
- 🧠 I treat every project like a micro-startup — with a focus on **problem-solving**, **scalability**, and **user experience**.
- 🛠️ I believe in **clarity over shortcuts**, **principles over hype**, and **execution over fluff**.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

> "If you can't build with it, you haven't learned it."

Here's how I level up:

1. Learn from **docs + real docs** (not just YouTube)
2. Build real mini-projects immediately
3. Debug deeply until I get clarity
4. Refactor to improve readability and performance
5. Share what I learn publicly 💬

This loop has helped me master not just syntax — but also **problem-solving**, **code design**, and **system thinking**.
